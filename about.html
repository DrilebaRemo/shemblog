            I got my inspiration to this field from my curiosity
            I always wondered how all the apps, sites worked so I started my journey
            In my s4 vacation(2021) i went to stem cafe which is a great interactive center
            for computer training.
            I studied 3D modelling, basic python, and scratch as well as arduino for robotics
            I love software and i really want to have a career in this field
