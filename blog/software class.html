            <p>In our introdyction to sofftware development, we were introduced to html and css which are languages used to make a website.<br>
            HTML is used to create the content on a webpage and CSS is used to style the elemenys of the page.<br>
            We taken through by our facilitator Samson Kapeyi who is a very fun humorous and generous teacher<br>
            The class was fun and interactive, but i personally ran into challenges with GIT and bootstrap but with a little more practice Im sure i can make it</p>

            <h2>GIT</h2>
            <p>This is a software used by developer communities to share and work and each others code. Its used in version control</p>
            <h2>BOOTSTRAP</h2>
            <p>This is a software containing CSS classes which are already pre-defined and are used for specific functions<br>
            All you need to do is go to your IDE and edit the files with HTML and CSS so as to customise the classes and your work as well</p>
